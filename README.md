## Project Description :

	Flappy Bird was a popular side-scrolling mobile game first released on 24th May 2013  and became a sensation overnight in early 2014. Flappy Bird was removed from both the App Store and Google Play by showing its addictive nature and over usage. So, to play and introduced the flappy bird game on a Windows environment, we proposed a system that is designed to give a minimalistic and simplistic look and feel with lots and lots of new graphics. To provide a user-friendly and consistent experience, we use C++ language and SFML for graphics and its various functions and functionalities. In the game, the player controls a bird and navigates through sets of pipes without hitting them. The game is simple in concept, but challenging in practice, as the player must keep the bird flying by tapping the screen or pressing a key. Each successful pass through a set of pipes results in the player gaining a point, and the game ends if the bird hits a pipe or the ground. The game's addictive nature and simple, yet challenging gameplay have made it a popular choice among casual gamers.
